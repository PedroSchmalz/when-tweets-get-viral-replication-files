We made available the following replication files:

BERT+KFOLD(2020).ipynb: The code and results of the model trained only on 2020 tweets.

BERT+KFOLD(2021).ipynb: The code and results of the model trained only on 2021 tweets.

BERT+KFOLD(2020-21).ipynb: The code and results of the model trained on the tweets of both years.

Codebook: Additionally, we provide the codebook with informations on the dataset building process, classification rules and some additional content.

Note: The models were trained using Google Colaboratory GPU.

The corpus used on the training can be found on the following [site](https://github.com/PedroSchmalz/covid19-tweets-brazilian-mayoral-candidates)
